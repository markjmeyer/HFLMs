# HFLMs
 Online illustrations to accompany the HFLM review article Meyer, MJ (2023), "Advances in Estimation and Inference for HFLMs."

# Folder descriptions
 Scripts for running several of the methods described in the review are available in the Script folder.

 ## MATLAB-based Implementations
  Code to fit HFLMs in MATLAB as described by Malfait and Ramsay (2003) and Meyer, Malloy, and Coull (2021) are in the files malfait_script.m and meyer_script.m. To implement these, interested users will need to download the MATLAB code from https://github.com/markjmeyer/WPHFLM/tree/master/Code.
  
 ## R-based Implementations
  Code to produce HFLMs in R as described by Scheipl et al. (2015) and Brockhaus et al. (2017) are in the files scheipl_script.R and brockhaus_script.R. The R packages refund and FDBoost are required for fitting these models, respectively, and will need to be installed first.
